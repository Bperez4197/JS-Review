        <p>
          Fifa is a classic video game that I have played my whole life. I
          remember playing fifa 98 with my Dad on the playstation 1. Nowadays,
          even if you don't have someone in your household who wants to play you
          can join a match with someone in any part of the world. Recent fifas
          allow you to slowly build a dream team and compete against others in a
          mode called "Ultimate Team". It's a hobby I plan to maintain for many
          years to come.

        <p>
          I have played Call of Duty off an on since I was 14. This massive
          online game came into my left at an important age in that it allowed
          me to connect with others easily. Almost all the dudes I interacted
          with in high school played so right away I'd have something in common
          with them. It's also just a blast.
