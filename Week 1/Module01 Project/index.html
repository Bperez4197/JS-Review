          Hello, my name is Bryce. I am 26 years old and I was born and raised
          here in Phoenix, AZ. I really enjoy programming and building things as
          well as pouring time into my many hobbies. Some of these include
          lifting weights, playing video games, and reading. I am very close
          with my family and we like to get together and play board games. Some
          of the more recent games have been Splendor, 7 Wonders, and Unstable
          Unicorns. I hope to establish a career as a developer, preferablly an
          ios developer but I enjoy web dev as well. The dream would probably to
          just be location independent with my career and travel the states
          until I choose one to settle down in. Thanks for visiting my page!
