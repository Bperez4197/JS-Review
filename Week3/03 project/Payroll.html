    part B
    This program asks a user for a job title, how many hours they worked this week, and how many years they've worked for the restaurant. The program then returns the users gross pay depending on their answers.
    test cases:
    'K',40,3 -> 720
    'H',32,.75 -> 384
    'W',27,10 -> 162
